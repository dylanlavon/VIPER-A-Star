# VIPER PATHFINDING USING HPC

The goal of this project is to develop an understanding of pathfinding algorithms and how they could be used, particularly in an HPC environment, to calculate optimal paths for lunar rovers such as *VIPER*.

## To Do:
- [x] Add a timer
- [ ] Support diagonal movement
- [ ] Add octile heuristic
- [ ] Heightmap-to-pathfinding-map-data converter
- [ ] Load pathfinding map data from a file
- [ ] No-visualization mode / Only show final path
